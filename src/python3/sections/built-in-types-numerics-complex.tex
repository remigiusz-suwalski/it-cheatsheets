\subsubsection{complex -- a numeric type}
Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, which are each a floating point number.
To extract these parts from a complex number z, use z.real and z.imag.
(The standard library includes the additional numeric types fractions.Fraction, for rationals, and decimal.Decimal, for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.)
