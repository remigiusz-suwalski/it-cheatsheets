% 9.21. Aggregate Functions
\subsection{Aggregate functions}
Aggregate functions can't be used in the \mintinline{sql}{WHERE} clauses due to the order of evaluation of clauses. Therefore this works:
\begin{minted}[linenos,firstnumber=last]{sql}
SELECT * FROM cd.members
WHERE joindate = (SELECT MAX(joindate) FROM cd.members);
\end{minted}
And this does not:
\begin{minted}[linenos,firstnumber=last]{sql}
SELECT * FROM cd.members
WHERE joindate = MAX(joindate);
\end{minted}

Common aggregate functions are
\textbf{COUNT},
\textbf{MAX} (maximum),
\textbf{MIN} (minimum),
\textbf{SUM}.
