% 9.7. Pattern Matching
\subsection{Pattern matching}
% There's other ways to accomplish this task: Postgres supports regular expressions with the ~ operator, for example. Use whatever makes you feel comfortable, but do be aware that the LIKE operator is much more portable between systems.
\textbf{LIKE} provides pattern matching: underscore matches any single character, percentage matches any string (possible empty).
\begin{minted}[linenos,firstnumber=last]{sql}
SELECT * FROM cd.facilities WHERE name LIKE '%Tennis%';
\end{minted}
